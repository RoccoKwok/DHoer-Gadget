# DHoer - Gadget
To achieve full functionality, this program integrates several sensors, including motion and ultrasonic sensors, with an Arduino microcontroller. Upon receiving a signal from these sensors, the Arduino transmits data to the DHoer application, triggering the alert function.<br>
It associates with **DHoer-app** as a whole to do the function above.<br>
